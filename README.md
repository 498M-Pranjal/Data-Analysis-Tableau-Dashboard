# Data-Analysis-Interactive-Superstore-Tableau-Dashboard
**Project Description**
This project focuses on designing and developing an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Sample Superstore dataset to provide meaningful insights into business performance. The main purpose of the project is to convert raw sales and operational data into a visually engaging and easy-to-understand analytical solution that supports effective decision-making.
The dashboard is built with a two-plane layout, where the left panel contains the company logo, interactive controls, and filters, while the right panel presents multiple dynamic visualizations along with Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards. These KPIs include Profit Margin, Return Rate, and Number of Orders, which together offer a comprehensive view of financial health, customer activity, and operational efficiency.
A key highlight of this project is the use of a dynamic Metric parameter, allowing users to switch between Sales, Profit, and Number of Orders. Based on the selected metric, all charts, titles, and tooltips update automatically, enabling flexible analysis without navigating between different dashboards. This feature enhances user experience and makes the dashboard more interactive and efficient.
To further improve usability, the dashboard includes filters for Year and Region, along with a show/hide toggle button that helps users control the display of filters and maximize viewing space. The project also ensures consistent insights by implementing a Top 5 Products view using FIXED level-of-detail expressions, so that top-performing products remain visible regardless of filter selections.
Advanced interactivity is achieved through filter actions, where selecting a category dynamically updates all other charts and KPI cards. The inclusion of trend lines and average reference lines helps highlight patterns and benchmarks, enabling users to better understand performance trends over time.
Additionally, the dashboard logo is configured as a clickable element that redirects users to the published version of the dashboard on Tableau Public, improving accessibility and navigation. Overall, this project demonstrates the effective use of data visualization best practices, interactive dashboard design, and analytical storytelling, making it a strong example of how Tableau can be used to deliver impactful business intelligence solutions.
